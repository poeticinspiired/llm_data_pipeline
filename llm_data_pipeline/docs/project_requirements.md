# Project Scope and Requirements

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a scalable data pipeline for collecting, cleaning, and curating a dataset suitable for training a small-scale language model. The focus is on legal or news-related text, which provides structured, high-quality content that is valuable for language model training.

## Data Sources
### Legal Text Option
- **Target Sources**: Public domain court rulings, legal opinions, and case law
- **Potential Sources**:
  - Public.Resource.Org
  - CourtListener
  - Supreme Court opinions archive
  - State court websites with public APIs
- **Data Characteristics**: Formal language, structured arguments, specialized vocabulary

### News Text Option
- **Target Sources**: Public domain news articles, press releases
- **Potential Sources**:
  - Common Crawl news subset
  - Archive.org news collections
  - Public news APIs (e.g., NewsAPI)
  - Government press releases
- **Data Characteristics**: Current events, varied topics, journalistic style

## Data Volume and Scale
- **Initial Target**: 1-5 GB of raw text data
- **Document Count**: Approximately 100,000-500,000 documents
- **Scaling Considerations**: Pipeline should be designed to scale to 50+ GB with minimal modifications

## Functional Requirements

### Data Collection
- Web scraping capabilities for multiple sources
- Rate limiting and polite crawling practices
- Support for different input formats (HTML, XML, JSON, PDF)
- Metadata extraction (date, source, author, categories)
- Incremental collection to avoid duplicates

### Data Processing
- Text extraction from various formats
- Deduplication at document and paragraph levels
- Language detection and filtering
- Content quality assessment
- Sentence segmentation
- Tokenization suitable for LLM training
- Basic NLP preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation handling)

### Data Storage
- Raw data storage in cloud-compatible format
- Processed data in NoSQL database with appropriate indexing
- Metadata storage and linking to raw content
- Version control for processed datasets

### Pipeline Orchestration
- Workflow definition for all pipeline stages
- Scheduling capabilities
- Failure handling and recovery
- Monitoring and logging
- Resource utilization optimization

## Technical Requirements

### Programming Languages and Libraries
- **Primary Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or similar
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NLTK, spaCy
- **Database Interaction**: PyMongo or similar

### Infrastructure
- **Database**: MongoDB for document storage
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 or Azure Data Lake
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow or Prefect
- **Containerization**: Docker for reproducibility

### Performance Requirements
- Parallel processing for CPU-bound tasks
- Efficient memory usage for large documents
- Batch processing capabilities
- Incremental processing support

## Output Deliverables
- GitHub repository with complete code
- Comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions
- Architecture documentation
- Jupyter notebook demonstrating:
  - Sample data processing workflow
  - Data quality metrics and visualizations
  - Basic analysis of the curated dataset
- Small sample dataset (cleaned and processed)

## Constraints and Considerations
- Only use publicly available and legally accessible data
- Respect robots.txt and website terms of service
- Implement appropriate rate limiting
- Document all data cleaning decisions
- Ensure reproducibility of the entire pipeline
